# Plant Book

### Motivation 
My motivation for this app stems from my recent hobby I picked up during quarantining, gardening. I found it time consuming to look up individual plants to figure out their individual needs. Instead, I’d rather rely on a single place where I can refer to. By being able to write down your own notes, you can do the research of what your plants need and jot it down in the app. That way, when you need to refer to any plant needs. You don’t have to waste time Googling the same plant multiple times or try to piece together contradicting information. 

### Current Status
Currently, on the app the user can create their own account, make a plant, delete a plant, and update an existing plant. I tried implementing a filter option, however, it failed to work. So that still needs some work to be done.
